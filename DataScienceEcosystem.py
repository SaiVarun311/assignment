# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
# 

# **Objectives:**
# - List popular languages for data science.
# - List popular libraries for data science.
# - List popular tools used for data science.
# - perform simple arithmetic operation.
# - convert 200 minutesinto hours.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. Scala
#     

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. Pytorch
# 2. Numpy
# 3. Pandas
# 4. Tensorflow

# | MLFlow             |
# | Spark              |

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[2]:


(3*4)+5
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers


# In[3]:


(200/60)
#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
